# ```{rubric} Resources
# ```
# ---
# We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this
# as a conscious choice for the user. This also increases chances charts
# run on environments with little
# resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
# lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
#
# ```{code-block} yaml
# :caption: resources example
#   limits:
#     cpu: 100m
#     memory: 128Mi
#     storage: 50Gi
#   requests:
#     cpu: 100m
#     memory: 128Mi
#     storage: 5Gi
# ```
#
# ```{literalinclude} /values.yaml
# :language: yaml
